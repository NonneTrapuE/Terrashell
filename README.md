# Terrashell
Terrashell is an open source alternative to Terraform written in Powershell

## Why Powershell ?
Powershell is a great open source scripting language from Microsoft. It works in Linux, macOS and ... Windows. Of course.
Powershell has one great advantage: it benefits from a huge community of users and developpers.
And i think create provisionners from Powershell is simpliest because community works hard to create modules of everything (really everything...).
Provisionners can be develop from modules, and developpers can gain many hours.

## For testing 
Terrashell is only for developpers now. No provisionners are existing today for Terrashell.
But i works to develop quickly one for start.
Maybe it's for VMWare ESX.
For testing Terrashell, install Powershell 7.2 or early form [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/shows/it-ops-talk/how-to-install-powershell-7)

## Toml
Toml is a configuration language, like XML or JSON, but easier to understand by humans.
It's for that i choice this language
